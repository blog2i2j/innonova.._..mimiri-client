# Contributing to Mimiri Notes

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mimiri Notes! We appreciate your support and would love to have you as part of our community.

## Current State

We want to be transparent about the current state of the project: **setting up a full development environment is challenging** at this stage. Here's why:

- **Server infrastructure** - The backend setup requires server configuration, RSA keys, and other complexities that aren't yet streamlined
- **Mobile builds** - While technically possible, building for iOS and Android requires platform-specific tooling and signing certificates that can be difficult to configure
- **Electron builds** - Desktop builds are more accessible but still require coordination with the [mimiri-client-electron](https://github.com/innonova/mimiri-client-electron) repository
- **Dependencies** - The full system requires coordination between multiple repositories (client, server, electron wrapper)

We're working toward making the development setup more accessible, but we're not there yet. **We don't want to oversell what's currently practical.**
